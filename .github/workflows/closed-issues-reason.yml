            * [ ] You did not follow our template. Please follow the Issue template to help us identify your issue more effectively.
            * [ ] You did not provide any information about your versions (We absolutely need the exact version numbers that are installed on your Server, \"latest\" is not helpful)
            * [ ] You did not provide a proper description to the problem. Try to write at least 4-6 sentences and/or provide screenshots or videos on how to reproduce this.
            * [ ] We were unable to reproduce issue, if you think your issue still persists then please comment down below and give a better description on how to reproduce it.
            * [ ] Your issue was posted in a foreign language, we only accept english issues on here.
            * [ ] Your issue is not a bug, it is intended to work this way.
            * [ ] Your issue is not really a bug, it is a limitation or simply something we have no control over.
            * [ ] Your issue is not a bug, please only use this issue tracker to report bugs. Any other kind of communication should happen on discord.
            * [ ] Your issue has already been reported before, it is a duplicate. Check the other issues first before posting!
            * [ ] You posted an error without using pastebin. Please always post errors via pastebin otherwise they become nearly unreadable.
            * [ ] You seem to be reporting multiple bugs at once. Please make a separate issue for each bug you encountered, so we can properly handle them individually.
            * [ ] Your issue has already been fixed in a later version of Slimefun, you should update.
            * [ ] You are using an outdated and unsupported version of Slimefun, again, you should update.
            * [ ] You are using an unofficially modified build of Slimefun. We only support official versions of Slimefun - for obvious reasons.
            * [ ] You are using an unsupported version of Minecraft. We only provide support for the Minecraft versions Slimefun was developed for, older versions are not supported anymore.
            * [ ] You are using a \"stable\" version of Slimefun (prefixed with \"RC - \"), your issue may have been fixed in a development build, so we only accept bug reports from those.
            * [ ] You are on the wrong issue tracker. We would like to remind you that this Issue Tracker is **only for Slimefun**. To report bugs on any addons, head to the corresponding issue tracker of that addon.
