# Slimefun 4 - Additional Teleporters
*Originial Plugin: [**Click here**](https://github.com/thebusybiscuit/Slimefun4/)*

This plugin just adds a new item, the group teleporter activation plate, this allows you to right click the plate and whitelist players in a gui so only specific players may use your teleporter!

**NOTE:** This does not work yet, please use the original [plugin](https://github.com/thebusybiscuit/Slimefun4/)
