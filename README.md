# Slimefun 4 - Additional Teleporters
*Originial Plugin: [**Click here**](https://github.com/thebusybiscuit/Slimefun4/)*

This plugin just adds a new item, the group teleporter activation plate, this allows you to right click the plate and whitelist players so only specific players may use your teleporter! It works very much like the teleporter waypoint system.

How to use:

- Right click teleporter plate to add somebody to the whitelist
- In the gps control panel, theres white wool, that will let you to remove whitelisted players

Known Issues:

- if you add somebody to the whitelist, you'll need to reload or restart server for it to properly take effect
- if a player is offline, you cannot add them to the whitelist
- the whitelist menu in the gps control panel shows UUIDs instead of names
