# Slimefun 4 - Additional Teleporters
*Originial Plugin: [**Click here**](https://github.com/thebusybiscuit/Slimefun4/)*

This plugin just adds a new item, the group teleporter activation plate, this allows you to right click the plate and whitelist players so only specific players may use your teleporter!

Known Issues:

- if you add somebody to the whitelist, you'll need to reload or restart server for it to properly take effect
- if a player is offline, you cannot add them to the whitelist
- the whitelist menu in the gps control panel shows UUIDs instead of names
