# Slimefun 4
Slimefun is a plugin which aims to turn your Bukkit/Spigot Server into a modpack without ever installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks! Slimefun lets every player decide on their own how much they want to dive into Magic or Tech.<br>
We got everything from magical wands to nuclear reactors.<br>
We feature a magical altar, an electric power grid and even item transport systems.

This project originally started back in 2013 and has grown ever since.<br>
From one single person working on this plugin back then, we grew to a community of thousands of players and over 100 of contributors to this project.<br>
It currently adds over **500 new items and recipes** to Minecraft ([Read more about the history of this project](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Slimefun-in-a-nutshell)).

But it also comes with a lot of Addons too!<br>
Check out our [Addons](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons), you may find exactly what you were looking for.

## Download Slimefun 4
(See also: [How to install Slimefun](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Installing-Slimefun))<br>
Slimefun 4 can be downloaded **for free** on our builds page.<br>
We currently provide two versions of Slimefun, development builds and "stable" builds.<br>
Here is a full summary of the differences between different versions of Slimefun.

| | development (latest) | "stable" |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| **Minecraft version(s)** | :video_game: 1.13.X - 1.15.X | :video_game: 1.13.X - 1.15.X |
| **testing before release** | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **latest content** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Discord support** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Bug Reports** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **frequent updates** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **change logs** | :x: | :memo: **[change log](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** |
| **Download link** | :package: **[download latest](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/master/)** | :package: **[download "stable"](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/stable/)** |

**! We wholeheartedly recommend you to use development builds !**

"Stable" builds do not receive frequent updates or fast patches. Therefore they will always contain a lot more bugs than the develoment builds. We will also not accept or review any bug reports from "stable" builds. These are just old development builds that seemed to run without any major issues.<br>
**Why use a "stable" build then?** While "stable" builds contain more bugs than development builds you can be sure that they will not include game-breaking issues, development builds almost never contain such issues either. But if your server/business heavily depends on a version of Slimefun that you need to rely on, you are forgiven if you choose the "stable" branch.<br>
**What exactly are these "stable" builds then and why do you put them in quotes?** "Stable" builds are literally just outdated development builds that seemed to run fine without any major issues. But they are not exactly bug-free hence why actually calling them stable would be hypocritical. However these builds can only really stay "stable" if there are enough people using development builds to report bugs. Otherwise potential issues may go unnoticed and slip into "stable" builds. Again, we really recommend you to choose the development builds. But since many people really wanted "stable" builds, they are now an option too.

Whatever version of Slimefun you choose, we also recommend you to keep `auto-updates` enabled to receive automatic patches and fixes for Slimefun!

### Code Quality
Slimefun uses [Sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) to monitor Code Quality.

| [Overall Maintainability](https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/user-guide/metric-definitions/#maintainability) | "Code Smells" | "Technical Debt" | Test Coverage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [![Maintainability Rating](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4&metric=sqale_rating)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) | [![Code Smells](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4&metric=code_smells)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) | [![Technical Debt](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4&metric=sqale_index)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) | [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) |

##### "Code Smells"
Code Smells are portions of the source code that are confusing, lack documentation or are just done very badly in general. These code smells should be held to a bare minimum.

_Please contact us on [Discord](#discord) before working on any code smells. Some design patterns may not be changed abruptly because an addon might depend on them._

##### "Technical Debt"
Technical Debt is basically an estimate for how long it would take to fix all issues and code smells.

##### Test Coverage
Slimefun now also uses Automated Tests to determine whether an update could break something. The coverage shows how much these tests cover. Higher coverage means less breaking changes and in turn better and more reliable builds.
Due to this being a very huge project though, getting to `100% coverage` is probably impossible. But increasing that number even slightly still helps. So feel free to write Unit Tests for Slimefun and place them in the [/src/test/java/](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/tree/master/src/test/java) folder.


## Disclaimers
Slimefun4 uses various systems that collect usage information or download automatic updates as well as the latest information about the project.
We do not collect any personal information from you but there are some services that may gather or download some data.

You can opt-out of the Auto-Updater and stats collection at any time.

#### Auto-Updates
Slimefun4 uses an Auto-Updater which connects to https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/ to check for and download updates.<br>
This behaviour is enabled by default but can be turned off under `/plugins/Slimefun/config.yml`.<br>
We highly recommend you to keep this on at any time though, as you could be missing out on important patches.

#### Metrics and Statistics
Slimefun4 uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574) to collect anonymous information about the usage of this plugin.<br>
This is solely for statistical purposes, as we are interested in how Servers/Players use this plugin.<br>
All available data is anonymous and aggregated, at no point can we see individual server or player information.<br>
All of the collected data is publicly accessible: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574

You can also disable this behaviour under `/plugins/bStats/config.yml`.<br>
For more info see [bStats' Privacy Policy](https://bstats.org/privacy-policy)

#### GitHub Integration
Lastly, Slimefun4 connects to https://api.github.com/ to gather information about this open-source project.<br>
No information about your Minecraft Server is sent to GitHub.

This information includes (but is not limited to)
* list of contributors, their username and profile link (from the repositories `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4`, `Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki` and `Slimefun/Resourcepack`)
* amount of open issues in this repository
* amount of pending pull requests in this repository
* amount of stars in this repository
* amount of forks of this repository
* amount of code-bytes in this repository
* date of the last commit to this repository

Additionally the plugin connects to https://mojang.com/ to retrieve the Minecraft skins of our contributors (if possible).<br>
Note that this project is not associated with Mojang AB.
