# Slimefun 4
*Looking for the download link? [**Click here**](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/README.md#floppy_disk-download-slimefun-4)*

Slimefun is a plugin which aims to turn your Spigot Server into a modpack without ever installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks! Slimefun lets every player decide on their own how much they want to dive into Magic or Tech.<br>
We got everything from magical wands to nuclear reactors.<br>
We feature a magical altar, an electric power grid and even item transport systems.

This project originally started back **in 2013** and has grown ever since.<br>
From one single person working on this plugin back then, we grew to a community of thousands of players and hundreds of contributors to this project.<br>
It currently adds over **500 new items and recipes** to Minecraft ([Read more about the history of this project](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Slimefun-in-a-nutshell)).

But it also comes with a lot of addons! Check out our [addons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons), you may find exactly what you were looking for.

## :floppy_disk: Download Slimefun 4
Slimefun requires your Minecraft Server to be running on [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) or on any fork of these.<br>
(See also: [How to install Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Installing-Slimefun))

Slimefun 4 can be downloaded **for free** on our builds page.<br>
We currently provide two distinct versions of Slimefun, development builds and "stable" builds.<br>
Here is a full summary of the differences between the two different versions of Slimefun.

| | development (latest) | "stable" |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| **Minecraft version(s)** | :video_game: **1.16.\* - 1.20.\*** | :video_game: **1.16.\* - 1.20.\*** |
| **Java version** | :computer: **Java 16 (or higher)** | :computer: **Java 16 (or higher)** |
| **automatic updates** | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **frequent updates** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **latest content** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Discord support** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Bug Reports** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **testing before release** | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **change logs** | :x: | :memo: **[change log](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** |
| **Download links** | :floppy_disk: **[download latest](https://blob.build/project/Slimefun4/Dev)** | :floppy_disk: **[download "stable"](https://blob.build/project/Slimefun4/RC)** |

**:exclamation: We wholeheartedly recommend you to use _development builds_, they are the most recent version of Slimefun and also receive the most frequent updates! In fact, "stable" builds are so outdated that we won't accept bug reports from them at all.**
<details>
  <summary>Here's why...</summary>
  
"Stable" builds do not receive frequent updates or fast patches. As time goes on, bugs are fixed but it will take some time until these fixes make it into a "stable" build. We will also not accept or review any bug reports from "stable" builds. They are in fact just old development builds that seemed to run fine without any __major__ issues.

**:question: Why use a "stable" build then?**<br>
While "stable" builds most definitely contain more bugs than development builds due to their very slow update schedule. you can be sure that they will not include __game-breaking__ issues, but rest assured that development builds almost never contain such issues either. If your server or business however heavily depends on a version of Slimefun that does not change/update a lot, you are forgiven if you choose the "stable" branch. But development builds will bring you the best experience, both in terms of features and bug fixes.

**:question: What exactly are these "stable" builds then and why do you put them in quotes?**<br>
"Stable" builds are literally just outdated development builds that seemed to run fine without any __major__ issues. But they are far from bug-free hence why actually calling them stable would be hypocritical. However these builds can only really stay "stable" if there are enough people using development builds and report any bugs they come across. Otherwise potential issues may go unnoticed and slip into a "stable" build. Again, we really recommend you to choose the development builds. But since a few people really wanted "stable" builds, they are now an option too.

## :exclamation: Disclaimers
Slimefun4 uses various systems that collect usage information or download automatic updates as well as the latest information about the project.
We do not collect any personal information from you but there are some services that may gather or download some form of data.

You can opt-out of the Auto-Updater and stats collection at any time!

<details>
  <summary>Automatic updates</summary>
  
Slimefun4 uses an Auto-Updater which connects to https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/ to check for and download updates.<br>
This behaviour is enabled by default but can be turned off under `/plugins/Slimefun/config.yml`.<br>
We highly recommend you to keep this on at any time though, as you could be missing out on important patches.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Metrics and Statistics</summary>
  
Slimefun4 uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574) to collect anonymous information about the usage of this plugin.<br>
This is solely for statistical purposes, as we are interested in how Servers/Players use this plugin.<br>
All available data is anonymous and aggregated, at no point can we see individual server or player information.<br>
All of the collected data is publicly accessible: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574

You can also disable this behaviour under `/plugins/bStats/config.yml`.<br>
For more info see [bStats' Privacy Policy](https://bstats.org/privacy-policy)

Our [bStats Module](https://github.com/Slimefun/MetricsModule) is downloaded automatically when installing this Plugin, this module will automatically update on server starts independently from the main plugin. This way we can automatically roll out updates to the bStats module, in cases of severe performance issues for example where live data and insight into what is impacting performance can be crucial.
These updates can of course be disabled under `/plugins/Slimefun/config.yml`. To disable metrics collection as a whole, see the paragraph above.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>GitHub Integration</summary>
  
Lastly, Slimefun4 connects to https://api.github.com/ to gather information about this open-source project.<br>
No information about you or your Minecraft Server is sent to GitHub.

This information includes (but is not limited to)
* list of contributors, their username and profile link (from the repositories `Slimefun/Slimefun4`, `Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki` and `Slimefun/Resourcepack`)
* amount of open issues in this repository
* amount of pending pull requests in this repository
* amount of stars in this repository
* amount of forks of this repository
* amount of code-bytes in this repository

</details>

Additionally the plugin connects to [textures.minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) to retrieve the Minecraft skins of our contributors (if possible).<br>

*Note that Slimefun is not associated with `Mojang Studios` or `Minecraft`.*
