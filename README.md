# Slimefun 4
Slimefun is a plugin which aims to turn your Bukkit/Spigot Server into a modpack without installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks!
It adds a whole new layer of survival to your server by adding more than 490+ new Items!

But it also comes with a lot of Addons too!<br>
Check out our [Addons](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons), you may find exactly what you wanted there.

Slimefun 4 is licensed under 
[GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Download Slimefun 4
Use the stable builds, if your Server is heavily reliant on Slimefun not breaking.
But please also consider using development builds. If plenty of people use the development builds, then we can quickly work together on solutions for issues that arise.
**We will NOT accept bug reports from "stable" versions, as they are basically just old development builds**

## Data Collection
Slimefun4 uses various systems that collect or download data.<br>
We do not collect any personal information from you but here is a full list of what services may collect or download other kind of data.

### Auto-Updates
Slimefun4 uses an Auto-Updater which connects to https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/ to check for and download updates.<br>
This behaviour is enabled by default but can be turned off under `/plugins/Slimefun/config.yml`<br>
We highly recommend you to keep this on at any time though, as you could be missing out on important patches.

### Metrics and Statistics
Slimefun4 uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574) to collect anonymous information about the usage of this plugin.<br>
This is solely for statistical purposes, as we are interested in how Servers/Players use this plugin.<br>
All available data is anonymous and aggregated, at no point can we see individual server or player information.<br>
All of the collected data is publicly accessible: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574

You can also disable this behaviour under `/plugins/bStats/config.yml`.<br>
For more info see [bStats' Privacy Policy](https://bstats.org/privacy-policy)

### GitHub Integration
Lastly, Slimefun4 connects to https://api.github.com/ to gather information about this open-source project.<br>
No information about your Minecraft Server is sent to GitHub.

This information includes (but is not limited to)
* list of contributors, their username and profile link (from the repositories `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4`, `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki` and `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Resourcepack`)
* amount of open issues in this repository
* amount of pending pull requests in this repository
