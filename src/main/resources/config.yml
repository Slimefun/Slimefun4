  # Instead of disabling Auto Updates consider using the "stable" version of Slimefun.
  # These builds are much more tested and are far less likely to have any issues.
  # Note: When running a stable build auto-updates ONLY update to other stable builds! Perfect eh?
  # You can download the latest stable build here: https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/stable/
