# ADR

An ADR (Architecture Decision Record) is a document describing large changes, why we made them, etc.

## Making a new ADR

If you're making a large change to Slimefun, we recommend creating an ADR
in order to document why this is being made and how it works for future contributors.

Please follow the general format of the former ADRs or use a tool 
such as [`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to generate a new document.
